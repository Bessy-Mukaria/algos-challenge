## Adludio Data Science Challenge

### Project description
Adludio, an online mobile ad business , has Bayesian bandit algorithm applied to several campaigns  - to efficiently distribute 
a fixed budget between different adgroups within a campaign. There are a lot of unknown 
factors involved while measuring performance changes caused by this algorithm. The task is
